<h1>VLAN helper ?</h1>
I'm a system and network administrator for many years. I have been using VLAN for so long that I don't remember.
Recently, I have to use a switch from a company that uses the CISCO implementation to manage VLANs.
I couldn't understand this implementation. So I started learning and experimenting and I thought... Why not make a webapp to show the behavior between 2 network ports depending on the chosen parameters?

This is the goal of this little project.
For now it is based on the implementation of a FS switch (like CISCO). Eventually I think I will add other implementations like TP-Link, Netgear, D-Link...
